# Developer docs

This app is built on a SvelteKit + Convex + Better Auth starter. The auth, user and organization
code came from the `@auth/svelte` jsrepo registry (see `jsrepo.config.ts`).

## Stack

- **SvelteKit 3** with Svelte 5 (runes) and TypeScript
- **Convex**: database, server functions, file storage, realtime (`convex-svelte`)
- **Better Auth**, running inside Convex via `@convex-dev/better-auth`
- **Tailwind CSS 4** + **Bits UI** primitives with our own palette (`src/themes/palette.css`), plus svelte-toolbelt
- **Resend** (Convex component) for transactional email
- **Phone OTP** via Better Auth's `phoneNumber` plugin, delivered by textbee / WhatsApp / Fast2SMS (`src/convex/otp/`)
- **pnpm** as the package manager
